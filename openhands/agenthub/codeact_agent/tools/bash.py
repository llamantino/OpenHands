_DETAILED_BASH_DESCRIPTION = """Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.


### Command Execution
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.
* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)

### Long-running Commands
* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the "timeout" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.
* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:
  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs
  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process
  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process
  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer "timeout" parameter to let it run to completion

### Best Practices
* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.
* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.

### Output Handling
* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.

* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, you can set the "timeout" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
